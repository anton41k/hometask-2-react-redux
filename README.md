Your task is to rewrite the existing notes app using React.js, Redux (or Redux Toolkit).
All the functionality should be the same - users can add, edit and remove notes, archive and unarchive them.  
Store data in the redux store. Prepopulate it with 7 notes and use it by default as an initial state so that they are shown when the page is reloaded.
Aim to structure components properly (container, page, component), reuse components, and reflect the apps component hierarchy:

Bonus task: Tables for “List of notes” and “Summary” should use the same table component.
